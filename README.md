<p>The basic functions of the app are in place and working:</p>

## How to run the app

1. clone the repository
2. Run back-end directories using IntelliJ in order:
  a. archive-config-service
  b. EurekaServiceRegistry
  c. random-topic-service
  d. archive -cloud-service
  e. back-end[record-collection]
3. Run the react-front directory using a terminal such as VSC or powershell by first installing all packages with "npm install" in the root file.
  Then run "npm start" in the terminal, which should open a new browser window. Give the react app a few moments to upload the page, then test out the features.
